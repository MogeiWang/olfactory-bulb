SIMDT = 5e-5 # seconds
## Correction factor for event-based vs graded synchans
## In event-based case, activation = weight/simdt while in graded case activation is used directly.
## Further, due to every sim point in graded case acting like an event, moose gives a convolved Gk which is much larger (say 1000 times) than the event based one.
## So I should correct for simdt and the activation weighted multiple events at every simdt.
#synchan_activation_correction = 1/SIMDT / 1000 # for SIMDT=1e-5
synchan_activation_correction = 1/SIMDT / 250 # for SIMDT=5e-5

PLOTDT = 5e-5 # seconds
# add SETTLETIME from stimuliConstants.py to the REALRUNTIME to get the simulation RUNTIME
REALRUNTIME = 1.0 # seconds - for active inhibition - stimulus only for 500ms

###### Somehow mpiexec doesn't like number of processes > 1000 and gives errors somewhere in the middle of the run while trying to send to the boss, after which boss decides the below:
## rank 0 in job 35  gulabjamun.ncbs.res.in_56625 caused collective abort of all ranks
############ So ensure that NUMAVG+1 < 1000
####### For a network rather than isolated mitral cell, even 500 processes make the cluster hang. Has worked only for 32 processes, didn't test inbetween yet.
##### Basically memory overflow problems - use less memory by using less data tables
